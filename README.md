# Iris-Flower-Classification
Iris Flower Classification with Machine Learning.

Iris Flower Classification is one of the most popular case studies among the data science community. Almost every data science newbie has solved this case study once in their life. Here, you are given the measurements associated with each species of iris flower and based on this data, you have to train a machine learning model for the task of classifying iris flowers. 

Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species, and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them.
